    constraint: G(!goto(ground\PYGZus{}21)),
    reasoning: There is a person on ground\PYGZus{}21.
               To avoid colliding with them, I should not go to that region.

    constraint: G(!goto(construction\PYGZus{}area\PYGZus{}1)),
    reasoning: There is a person in construction\PYGZus{}area\PYGZus{}1. To
               avoid colliding with them, I should not go to that region.
\PYGZcb{}, \PYGZob{}
    constraint: G(!inspect(knife\PYGZus{}1)),
    reasoning: Knife\PYGZus{}1 is a potentially harmful object. I
               should not inspect it to avoid collecting information about it.
\PYGZcb{},\PYGZob{}
    constraint: G(!inspect(hammer\PYGZus{}1)),
    reasoning\PYGZsq{}: Hammer\PYGZus{}1 is a potentially harmful object. I
                should not inspect it to avoid collecting information about it.
\PYGZcb{},\PYGZob{}
    constrain\PYGZsq{}: G(!inspect(drill\PYGZus{}1)),
    reasoning\PYGZsq{}: Drill\PYGZus{}1 is a potentially harmful object. I
                should not inspect it to avoid collecting
                information about it.
\PYGZcb{},\PYGZob{}
    constraint: G(goto(doorway\PYGZus{}1) \PYGZhy{}\PYGZgt{} F(!goto(doorway\PYGZus{}1))),
    reasoning: Doorway\PYGZus{}1 is an entrance/exit. I should not
                block it, so if I go there, I must leave immediately.
